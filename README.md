# N-Queen Visualiser

- N-Queens Visualizer is a web application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows you to visualize how the N-Queens algorithm works. The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

- This project aims to help people understand the N-Queens algorithm by providing a visual representation of the problem and the steps involved in solving it. The application takes an input value for the number of queens and generates a chessboard with the corresponding size. As the algorithm runs, the application highlights the positions of the queens on the board and shows how they avoid threatening each other.

- The project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end, and the N-Queens algorithm is implemented using recursion. The code is open-source and available on GitHub for anyone who wants to learn more about the algorithm or contribute to the project.

# How to use the application

- To use the N-Queens Visualizer, simply open the index.html file in your browser. You will be prompted to enter a number for the size of the chessboard and click the "Start" button. The application will then generate the chessboard and start solving the N-Queens puzzle. You can see the progress of the algorithm by watching the queens move around the board and avoiding each other. Once a solution is found, the application will display a message indicating that the puzzle has been solved.
